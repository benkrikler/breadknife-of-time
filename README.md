# The breadknife of time
Takes a video and converts it into a [slit-scan style image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit-scan_photography).
If every frame in your video is stacked on top of the last, the image becomes a 3D block of what was seen.
It's like building a loaf of bread by stacking the individual slices together.
Now we take this tool, and slice the loaf along the direction we were stacking things:
we get a slice of what was seen in the same location, but at different moments.
This tool is basically a breadknife for time.
